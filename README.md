#Part 1 A syntaxic parser of an arithmetic expression using LEX and YACC.
#Part 2 It is complete the work done in Part 1 to evaluate the given arithmetic expression as input if the expression is syntactically correct. Additional functions often used in expression evaluators are included in the evaluator. These functions can be used with nests and they are: the sum, the product, mean, variance, standard deviation, max and min. 
#Part 3 Here we are considering non known operands. If the input expression is syntactically correct, to generate an intermediate form in the form of quadruplets and save it to an output file.
